# Alzheimer-s-Interactome
Utilizing network analysis to identify important protein interactions that can be further explored using computational and bioinformatic approaches for the purpose of drug development and understanding of the disease.
Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease pathologically characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques in the grey matter. It accounts for about 60 to 70% of dementia cases. Even though studies have identified misfolded Amyloid Beta (Aβ) protein and its precursor, Amyloid precursor protein APP(A4) to play a significant role in the plaque formation, the physiologic interactions of these proteins in the brain remains poorly understood. This knowledge gap hinders the development of effective drugs to halt the progression of the disease. In this regard, addressing this gap is crucial for identifying potential targets for effective drug development, advancing our understanding of the functional roles of proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease, reducing the socio-economic burden of the disease, improving care delivery for Alzheimer patients thereby reducing disease progression, and improving overall patient’s quality of life.
